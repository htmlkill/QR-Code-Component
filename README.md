## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- editor: Visualcode

### What I learned

- Proper placement and use of css codes
- Why html and css is so fluid
- The tags used in adding an icon to a webpage

<! Doctype html>
<h1> some HTML and CSS tags i used for the first time </h1>
HTML
<ul>
<li> table </lu>
<li> tr </li>
<li> th </li>
<li> div </li>
</ul>
CSS
<ul>
<li> box-shadow </li>
<li> border-radius </li>
</ul>

### Continued development

I saw the tags used in html for linking and creating images and setting the language preference of the project and want to continue exploring various ways i can use that to my advantage.
I'm not completely grounded in CSS but i am continuosly learning everyday.
Most especially learning more tedious codes such as Javascript and python (which i have basic knowledge in) and therefore combining them all, will allow me to professionally be able to tackle REACT.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for my shape designs. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS more. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to appreciate my mentor William who took his time and effort by creating spaces in between his work to put me through making and editing the project and introducing me to the code editors that was optimum for the performance.
